Ubuntu 18.04 VMWare
Command : $ rvm list
Error :   $ Warning! PATH is not properly set up, '/Users/kaityhallman/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/bin' is not at first place,
            usually this is caused by shell initialization files - check them for 'PATH=...' entries,
            it might also help to re-add RVM to your dotfiles: 'rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles',
            to fix temporarily in this shell session run: 'rvm use ruby-2.2.1'.
Actions : $ which ruby  # => /home/tools-aoeur/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.5/bin/ruby
          $ which gem   # => /home/tools-aoeur/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.5/bin/gem
          $ less ~/.bashrc  
            # => # Add RVM to PATH for scripting. Make sure this is the last PATH variable change.
                 export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"
                 export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
                 eval "$(rbenv init -)"
                 export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"

Cause : Conflict between rbenv and rvm 
Fix : - $ sudo apt remove rbenv 
      - Comment out (or delete) last lines in ~/.bashrc related to rbenv like following
        # Add RVM to PATH for scripting. Make sure this is the last PATH variable change.
          export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"
          #export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
          #eval "$(rbenv init -)"
          #export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"
        
Test : $ rvm list # => =* ruby-2.4.5 [ x86_64 ]
                        # => - current
                        # =* - current && default
                        #  * - default
