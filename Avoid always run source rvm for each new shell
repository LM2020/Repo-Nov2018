Ubuntu 18.04 VMWare

Wrong :  Each time open a new shell rvm progrem is not available untill running command : "source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm"

Actions : $ rvm info #=> no rvm command available

Cause : bash is not set for rvm 
Fix : - under certain user (regular user or root user)
      - $ gedit ~/.bashrc  ( as root user ) 
      - give this two lines to the bashrc file : source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm
                                                 export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin" 
      - close the shell and reopen a new one, rvm is always available for that user
